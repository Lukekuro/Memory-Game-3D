# Memory Game 3D in React App

Goal:
Create a simple "Memory" type puzzle game where the user has to find pairs of cards by revealing them.

What it includes:
1. User interface:
    * A game board that contains a set of cards (e.g. 4x4, i.e. 16 cards).
    * Each card is initially covered, and when clicked, the card is revealed.
    * The user can reveal two cards at once:
    * If the cards are the same, they remain revealed.
    * If the cards are different, they are covered again after a short while.
    * The game ends when all cards are revealed.

2. Application state:
    * Using React hooks (useState) to manage the state of the cards (whether they are covered, revealed, matched).
    * Updating the state after each player move (revealing cards, comparing them, resetting the game).

3. Components:
    * Card, Board, Game.

4. Other:
    * A move counter that shows how many attempts a player has made.
    * High scores saved in localStorage.
    * Animations when revealing cards.
    * Card drawing features.



# Getting Started with Create React App -- INFO about react

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
