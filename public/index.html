                  <li>A game board that contains a set of cards (e.g. 4x4, i.e. 16 cards).</li>
                  <li>Each card is initially covered, and when clicked, the card is revealed.</li>
                  <li>The user can reveal two cards at once</li>
                  <li>If the cards are the same, they remain revealed</li>

                  <li>The game ends when all cards are revealed</li>

                  <li>Updating the state after each player move (revealing cards, comparing them, resetting the game)</li>
